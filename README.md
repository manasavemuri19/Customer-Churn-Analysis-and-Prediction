# Customer-Churn-Analysis-and-Prediction
1. Analysed customer behaviour data to identify factors influencing churn.
2. Used Python with Pandas and NumPy in PyCharm to perform data cleaning, preprocessing, and statistical analysis on customer behavior datasets.
3. Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Matplotlib and Seaborn to identify patterns and churn indicators, followed by feature engineering to enhance model performance.
4. Built and evaluated machine learning models using Scikit-learn, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, achieving 80% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.80.
5. Designed interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize key churn drivers.
